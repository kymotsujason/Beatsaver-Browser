Beatsaver-Browser

*Currently inconvenient to use, DO NOT USE*

This is a standalone application for managing custom songs.
It keeps track of downloaded and installed songs, so you know what maps you've got and what maps you can get.
Built for Beatsaver.com but can be extended to other websites once development matures.

Current features:
- Download songs
- Install songs
- Uninstall songs
- Delete downloaded files
- Keep track of downloaded/installed files

TODO (important):
- Cache song info (instead of reloading every time on start, store the data and read it on startup)
- Apply downloaded/installed status to loaded maps (should have maps check if they're already downloaded/installed and apply that status on load/startup)
- Display status of whatever is going on (downloading/installing)

TODO (lower priority):
- Implement an actual GUI
- Display only needed information (button to show all info)
