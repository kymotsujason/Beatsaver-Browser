Beatsaver-Browser

*Currently only pulls 10 maps, will add in adjustable range soon*

This is a standalone application for managing custom songs.
It keeps track of downloaded and installed songs, so you know what maps you've got and what maps you can get.
Built for Beatsaver.com but can be extended to other websites once development matures.

Current features:
- Download songs
- Install songs
- Uninstall songs
- Delete downloaded files
- Keep track of downloaded/installed files
- Remember song info and load at startup (loading is hyper fast!)
- Apply status to maps (downloaded/installed)


TODO (important):
- Song preview + caching (imo, this is super important)
- Adjustable range of maps to check for (0-newest, currently set to 14-24)
- Display status of whatever is going on (downloading/installing)
- Additional safety checks to prevent or handle conflicts (ie. installing when already installed)

TODO (lower priority):
- Implement an actual GUI
- Display only needed information (button to show all info)
